## Learning Outcomes
- Database structure was one of the hardest things to understand. As I was building my project I came across one to many relations with the tables that had me going back and forth creating and deleting tables. I finally got my database set up successfully and included a forgein key. 
- I have a much better understanding of controllers and the difference between them
- I was convinced it was better to start off with how the project looks to the users and then work on the back end but I found starting off with my API Data controllers gave me a better understand of the project and it features
- Running the Data controllers helped me debug and look at my code in detail to refine the CRUD functionality of my feature
- commenting out almost every line of code helped me keep track as I went along. To which I thank you and Sean!
My data controllers for categories and Expenses are working as intended  

## Issues
- Quite a few issues
- The main thing was my computer couldn’t handle the load for Visual studio which crashed my entire laptop and I pretty much had to start back up from scratch 
- Starting with the Database: I think my structure is pretty decent although I’m having issues with the “DateTime” format.
- I have completed my CategoryController but when I go to add a category it doesn't take me back to the list page
- When I add a category it’s throwing an error saying category type is not INT.
- There is also an issue with my expense database: I manually added data but the everytime I add in and set the FK for category the PK in expenses sets to the same number and I'm not sure why that it
- As I’m typing this I’m realizing some of these issues are manageable but after working on it for 14 hours straight I'm starting to get tunnel vision. 

## Other functionality
- To refine this project I would like to add more features to it 
- Expense giving a weekly total
- Expenses having a monthly total
- Generating a bar chart of the total spending per category.
